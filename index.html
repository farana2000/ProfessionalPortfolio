              <p>In order to differentiate myself from competition I learnt how to develop a website to portray my skills as a tutor where my interest for software engineering began.

              <p> While on the course I was well equipped with technical skills such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and GIT.

Which not only allowed us to learn about the skills however also practice using them.</p>
